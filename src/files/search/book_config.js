The recent GDP numbers imply that ICT is currently the third-largest sector in Nigeria, even ahead of the oil and gas sector.  The volume of economic activity in the ICT sector is enormous. The IT industry as a component of the ICT sector is the  underlying infrastructure for banking, ﬁnance, and, increasingly, government services. IT innovation is also the leading area  of early-stage capital and investments in Nigeria, with about USD178 million and USD148 million invested in the IT  innovation space in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Therefore, the programs and policies of NITDA such as the Nigeria Cloud  Computing Policy (NCCP), the Nigeria ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship Vision (NIIEV), and the Guidelines for Nigerian  Content Development in ICT are all geared toward supporting the exponential growth of the IT industry as the leading  industry for job and wealth creation.

Go ahead and introduce yourself?    Tola: Hello everyone. My name is Tola Joseph Fadugbagbe , Founder Crypto Masterclass. I  started cryptocurrency ofﬁcially in 2017, even though I got to know about cryptocurrency in  2016 during the heat of MMM, but what attracted me to Bitcoin was because back in the  days we could provide help (PH) with Bitcoin to attract 50% ROI within a month. So after  MMM crashed, Bitcoin was still ﬂourishing in trading. So 2017 I just had to research more  on Bitcoin and decided to leverage more on the opportunities and here we are today  Over the years it has been wonderful, I started this just as a minor career and wanted  something that I can do without running either ways to achieve something tangible and  here came Bitcoin.  One interesting thing about Bitcoin is that it allows anyone to be a market participant  anywhere in the world. It doesn't matter whether you're in Africa, Asia or Europe, there is  no restriction.  Bitcoin, opened up the idea of an online marketplace. So if I want to sell Gold or Silver, the  best place to consider is to open an ofﬂine shop or store; but with Bitcoin, which is  intangible as digital money, it has helped to aid our understanding of digital markets which  has been so far fantastic.                                  Mr. Chuta: Quite recently various social media platforms have been agog with                                viral tweets and videos of your dissatisfaction with Nigeria's currency ﬁnancial                                system. How did that happen?    Tola: In March, this year the CBN stepped into the crypto space heavily and the  crypto community in Nigeria felt it.  By placing a ban on cryptocurrency transactions and remittance interfacing with  Nigerian banks and other ﬁnancial institutions providing various services to  crypto-based companies, the CBN touched the very fabric of our sustenance as  young people in this country. So I reacted to that memo from CBN just like I  always do online by guiding people against scams, and giving cryptocurrency tips.  I was of the opinion that the idea was a bad one, thereby making the video go  viral hence gaining global attention to such poorly thought out policy. Soon after,                                                                              12","Financial Times called me for an interview, likewise CNN called me from their  Atlanta Ofﬁce and scheduled an ofﬂine interview with me  Also, Dele Momodu, a Nigeria born veteran media practitioner now resident in  Ghana, saw the video and re-posted it on his Twitter & Facebook pages.  That was it!  Now people see me as a guru of a sort in crypto trading, but I am still learning.  You know why? Because the entire crypto space itself is still a work in progress.  So I'm still learning. So sometimes when I seek to get updates on Youtube, I'll be  surprised that, that same video that went viral is already posted on a particular  YouTube channel. And It has made me visible and created a massive impact. Till  date, I still receive calls globally on this subject, and it has been very wonderful.  Thank you.                                  Mr Chuta: I want us to look at something very important. What were you doing                                before you discovered Bitcoin? Do you think that your previous career choice                                would have given you the same type of inﬂuence, exposure or even ﬁnancial                                success as you have seen today? So let's start from where you were before                                crypto. Tell me something about your non-crypto background, Tola!    Tola: All right Mr. Chuta. The fact remains that I got myself engaged in so many  other businesses, including block moulding, real estate and building construction  before I found Bitcoin and Crypto. Or should I say Bitcoin and Crypto found me.  I'm the kind of person that has always wanted to excel in life. In case you don't  know, shortly after I left college in 2007, I was working on all kind of stuff here and  in 2010, I decided to return to Lagos. It was an idea my daddy didn't like but I was  adamant because my quest for success was strong. So I left for Lagos only telling  my sister. When he (my dad) later got to know and was unhappy about my  decision. I told him, he can take care of my siblings. I needed to face my future,  because I wanted to break that poverty jinx. I don't want to understand what  poverty is when I'm above 30.    Tola: So,... I tried so many things, but I would like to tell you the two recent ones.  Before I got myself into Bitcoin, I worked as a real estate manager managing  works on site. I work with Shugaban properties where we build and sell houses. I  sold concrete blocks. If you go to YouTube and type “builders choice blocked  industry”, you see the videos I uploaded on the channel. Now, if you asked me if I  would have embraced any of my two recent jobs before venturing into Bitcoin, I  will tell you that I may not, and it's very simple. Even though i got funded by the  federal government to start the block industry under the “You Win” initiative,  extreme indebtedness by non-paying customers almost ruined the business.  ! got about 9 million to start the business and the grant was well monitored. They  don't allow awardees to siphoned those funds as it came in trenches. In all  sincerity, the funds were invested on that business, I bought a truck and got a                                                                              13","space along Lekki -Epe Expressway where I molded the blocks, hired some labour  and was supplying blocks to customers in the Ikate, Lekki and its environs. After a  while I added the sale of Cement to my business by purchasing them at a Depot  to sell. And so, in as much as you are within the Ibeju Lekki LGA, I would supply  you. When crypto came, I was already facing recession in my business then, and  also that people would take my blocks and cements on credit and won't pay  back, even till date.    Tola: But when crypto came, it was like an option for me to consider. I never knew  that it would be this big. Now, if you introduce concrete block business to me,  because it's what I have done before, and you want me to pick between the two, I  will tell you, it's cryptocurrency!  Why?  What I have beneﬁtted from it within a short while is what I don't think I can  beneﬁt from concrete block business within a decade. I'm not trying to say block  business is not lucrative. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from venturing into  the business, I am only making a personal observation. This is because I don't  produce faulty blocks. I ensure that the materials are well mixed, adequate  cement, stone dust and water, always on site for supervision. I was not cutting  corners. But the reward is nothing compared to crypto currency. At the end of  the day, the proﬁt margin is usually very small. The cost of production was very  high compared to the proﬁt I was making. Sometimes when I pay workers their  wages I barely have anything left to cater for myself. I was just working like an  elephant and eating like an ant. However, I still have a passion for real estate and  to be sincere, I might revisit that business again when I'm more prepared. I love  being on construction sites.  I like the smell and noise of cement mixing machines.  In the last decade, the most proﬁtable business or investment in the world was  Bitcoin. You can do a Google search on it. It was the Bank of America securities  that ﬁrst published this at the end of last decade. So now, if we look at the  market capitalization, the innovations and all that, compared to this new decade,  we are just starting.  I can tell you categorically, cryptocurrency investment will still outperform in other  investments in the world in this current decade. However, to me, I don't see  money as what I want to make to impress or oppress people. I see money as  what I want to use to impart lives. It doesn't matter whether you have,...$1 billion  or $10 billion, the fact remains that you can't eat more than what your stomach  can take. You can't wear two clothes or sleep in two rooms at a time, So I want to  use money to create a legacy in the industry. I want to be known as a person that  has created a workforce of a 100 people or 500 or 1000, you know, just to impact  lives, create more jobs and all that.                             Chuta: What inﬂuenced your life as a crypto trader? Do you have any sources of                           inspiration, ...someone that you can say inspired you to really venture into                           cryptocurrencies because, I don't want to think that you just saw it, read about it                           online and boom, you jumped in. Were there any kind of inﬂuences, ...people who                           you admire or so to speak ...call it what you like, trying to follow their footprint or                           get monitored by them... in the space either locally or internationally, wherever.                           Can you remember any such names?                                                                              14","Tola: Sometimes in our lives, we're inspired by other people's ingenuities. The fact  remains that we have local ﬁgures that are just quiet , maybe because of  insecurity in the country and all that. But the fact remains that there is this man  called Roger Var. I used to wait for Roger Van to tweet,...I was always eager to  read his tweets, and engage in his conservation. It was during the era he was  advocating for autonomy of Bitcoin, and was evangelizing the gospel of Bitcoin!  Had this man not taken this task upon himself, perhaps Bitcoin education may  not even, get to someone like me as of 2016. So I went back to YouTube and  watched his past videos? And I could see that passion. Sometimes he feels like  crying when talking about bitcoin. He says things like “ why should a central  authority print money and then we have masses suffering because they don't  have access to print their own money.” Roger Van is one of those people that  have inspired me, you know, to consider cryptocurrency. And also, there is CZ of  Binance! He recently tweeted something on Twitter, which actually, you know,  moved me. He said, when he wanted to buy bitcoin it was around $600 then but  there was no money for him to buy Bitcoin, he had to sell his own house. I mean,  that is a huge sacriﬁce for someone to be homeless because they want to  leverage on something. It speaks volumes and look at him today. Now the  platform he has built is more proﬁtable and a leading ﬁnancial platform in the  world today. So these great men have inspired me a lot.                             Mr Chuta                           Tell us about your crypto-education background. Did you have to go through any                           kind of short courses before you founded “Crypto-Masterclass”? Did you ever                           have any opportunity like that for yourself to get a platform where you were able                           to be educated In crypto?    Tola:  If anyone says that they are the ultimate source of information. I won't agree with  that because information is passed via a Channel, from a teacher to a student  and that is learning. So in order for me to get information it means that I might  have learnt from various platforms, but there is a challenge with interpreting  information, just take an instance, back in the days in school, if your maths  teacher comes to class and say something, there would be different level of  understanding by the students; some may opt for after class tutorial or may  decide to learn from their fellow students.  I have various platforms where I used to read and interpret information. some of  the platforms I used then was either Bitcoin.com or bitcointalk.org. Every day I  must open the websites. The conversations there right now have moved to reddit  platform and other social media platforms such as Telegram and Twitter which  use.                                                                              15","Chuta:                                Interesting stuff. Now, you know, as people advance and succeed in life, there is a                                tendency to allow that success to get into your heads. They be come arrogant,                                they become a little bit disconnected from people, especially people that were at                                the same level that they were before they got successful. So how have you been                                able to manage your crypto success and still remain humble? I see a lot of the                                responses you give when people comment on your post/ updates or Facebook                                life videos. How have you been able to manage that? You know…. crypto can                                really make someone an overnight millionaire in $$$$$…. we've seen the                                movement of some few crypto-assets in the last few weeks...someone could                                literally turn into overnight billionaires. So tell me how you have been able to                                manage your success story.    Tola:  See, where I was raised, my culture and my background doesn't permit being arrogant. So  i have brought it into my crypto success life. If you asked me, the primary thing that made  me successful, I will tell you it's the people. It is the people that made me, not that I stole  from them. No, but their love & engagement. You know, talking about me, referring me to  others, just like you yourself. I think you referred that guy in Port Harcourt and the other  one in Abuja to me to train them on Crypto. It is all those recommendations and I have to  keep the respect. I want to keep relationships for as long as we exist as humans.    Tola:  There's no way money would go into my head. I mean, thinking about the lowest place a  man can be on earth. I have been there. So there is no way, even if I have $10 billion today,  it won't get into my head. I will still be Tola that I am. And of course, I need to engage more  with the people because they made me.                                  Mr Chuta                                I think Tola, you have made something out of this industry. So what advice can                                you give to someone who wants to venture into crypto space?    Tola:  Okay, let me summarize the advice with my discussion with two people  yesterday, one called from Russia, the order called from here in Nigeria. The  person from Russia had wanted to speak with me. I've not been available due to  my busy time but I eventually granted him an audience to call me yesterday via  telegram. He asked me how to make it big in the market since there money in  crypto. I told him that, even if you want to make short term proﬁts, build your  mindset towards a long-term plan. The other person that called me from Nigeria,  actually, a pastor, I said to him, when you come to the crypto space, forget about  your Ponzi mentality, Forget about your, get rich quick mentality and forget about                                                                              16","football betting mentality. If you desire wealth, not just about money, you need to  build a long-term mindset around crypto. You must see it as a career. You are  not obligated to anyone except you work in a blockchain company. But if you  want to be an investor, or you want to trade, see it as a long-term team venture.  You can't plant a seed today and expect it to grow the same day. It's not  possible! Someone joined our group from Europe and was expecting miracles.

Wealth is what you have come to gather, and it takes time. Thank  you.                             Mr Chuta:                           Now, let's jump into something that is a little bit current, ...the news that is taking                           the industry by the storm. Speciﬁcally the issuance of CDBC by the Central Bank                           of Nigeria, which is expected to be launched on 1st of October. So many of us                           were at the stakeholder's engagement and we asked several questions. What do                           you think, ...what's your opinion about Nigeria central bank launching CBDC? I                           mean, what do you think its impact would be to Nigeria economy ,for the people,                           and to the crypto industry generally.    Tola:  Thank you very much for that powerful and very important question. When we  started hearing the rumor that CBN would launch digital currency for the country,  I had two different opinions.  African nations will look up to Nigeria the same way the world was looking up to  Nigeria in the seventies when our naira was more valuable than the USD, but  because of corruption and insincerity on the part of the government where are  we today? As we speak today our naira is 509 times below a dollar, well that is  by the way. Now launching digital currency. Yes. In my opinion there will be a  separate wallet. The rules surrounding the naira would be the same rules that will  be applied on this digital currency. I think it will scale. Number two. If this currency  can be assessable and easily liquidated by anyone, anywhere in the world. Let me  explain that. Look at USD for instance, if you have USD, you don't need to bother  about what you are going to buy in any country, ...whatever country you go to  there's liquidity. If you take Naira to Asia, they will ask you what is this? We don't  need to print money before we spend money. I can't remember the last time I  was in the bank which means I don't have to touch money before I spend money, I  mean, I can decide I to buy something worth 10 million today? And I won't touch  cash. Just simple transfer. It is done. Same way. We don't need to print money  before we empower SMEs. So, with this digital currency, all of these can be done.  But my fear is that the approach maybe wrong. And if that's the case, then the  CBDC would-be dead-on arrival.                             Mr Chuta                           All right. Thank you so much. I can say that. It's been a very wonderful time.                                                                              17","Bantu Blockchain Foundation Community Meetup in Partnership  with BNUG.

Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto came about the ﬁrst    cryptocurrency to the universe, a whole lot    has occurred in the crypto world.    For the sake of this article, I'll elaborate on three    effects cryptocurrency is currently having on    the global economy.    1.It dares the dollar standard: In case most of us    don't know, the entire global economy depends    on the US Dollar. In simpler terms, it's the reserve    currency of the world. All ﬁnancial players all    over the universe operate in the US market.This is    the main reason why any disruption in the    US ﬁnancial market affects the entire globe.    This form of centralization is gradually changing    through the introduction of cryptocurrency. All    cryptocurrency transactions are generally    decentralized on a very huge scale. As a matter of    fact, it might be a genuine means of de-dollarizing    the economy.    2.

What are they?   A Cryptocurrency wallet is a software that helps users to store, retrieve, send   and receive a given crypto asset. A wallet address is similar to a physical   address or an email. It is the only information you need to provide for   someone to pay you with or send you a crypto asset. Eg. Bitcoin.     A wallet actually contains your private key(s) which allow you to spend the   bitcoins allocated to it in the blockchain and a Public Key or address which you   will give out to the person you will be receiving the asset from.     A crypto wallet can show you the total balance of all crypto it controls and lets   you pay a speciﬁc amount to a speciﬁc person, just like a real wallet. A private   key is a combination of both your public key and private key. Look at it like a   padlock and its key.     Never under any circumstance share or disclose your private key to anyone.   Whoever has the private key has the funds it holds.     Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets   Cryptocurrency wallets can be divided into two main types viz;   • Cold Wallets   • Hot Wallets   Cold wallets refer to a method of “cold storage” for your cryptocurrency and   comes in the form of paper wallets, hardware wallets or on a USB drive.   They are completely ofﬂine. Two of the most prominent types of cold wallets   are hardware wallets and paper wallets.     Paper Wallets   A paper wallet is the combination of the private key(s) and a printed public   key. You can either use a paper wallet generator to print your wallet or simply   copy/paste your private keys into a document and hit print.     Hardware Wallets   Hardware wallets are cold wallets that need to be online to be able to   transact. These wallets are designed with the sole purpose of securely   storing cryptocurrencies. The device itself and its pin acts as layers of   authentication before your crypto can be sent to another wallet. Only buy   hardware devices from well-known manufacturers, such as   Ledger, Trezor or Keepkey.   Never buy a second-hand hardware wallet!     Hot Wallets   In contrast to cold wallets, hot wallets are always connected to the Internet.   People choose hot wallets for convenience rather than security. They're   useful for holding smaller sums of cryptos to transact regularly. Different   types include web, desktop and mobile wallets.     Web Wallets   Web wallets are usually managed by third parties. They’re simple to use,   easily set up and can’t be physically stolen.

Our roadmap also shows that the DAO, at some point, will also be deployed on other platforms like Polygon,  Polkadot, Solana etc.                                                                                                Key things about DAOs;                                                                                              • Member-owned community without                                                                                                      centralized leadership.                                                                                              • A safe way to collaborate with internet                                                                                                      strangers.                                                                                              • A safe place to commit funds to a                                                                                                      speciﬁc cause.                                                                                              • An effective and safe way to work with                                                                                                      like-minded folks around the globe.                                                                                              • DAOs are digital representations of                                                                                                      traditional organizations, which have a                                                                                                    common purpose, coordinated effort,                                                                                                    division of labor, and trusted authority                                                                                                    (code).                                                                                              •                                                                                              BNUGDAO Speciﬁcations                                                                                              First, every DAO has to have some kind of                                                                                              internal property, a token that can be spent                                                                                     70","by the organization or used by the community to reward certain activities within it, which the majority consider  valuable.  BNUG Token is that internal property that could be owned by anyone.  Owning a BNUGDAO token bestows a right that results in product usage, a governance action, a given  contribution, voting, or plain access to the ecosystem product or market. By holding a BNUGDAO Token, every  user gets voting rights and subsequently the ability to inﬂuence the way BNUG Community operates while also  facilitating the distribution and sharing of rewards and beneﬁts to all of its stakeholders.    All of the BNUG Community rules, ﬁnancial transactions decisions, where and how to spend funds are made by  reaching a consensus and thereafter recorded on the Blockchain.  This makes BNUGDAO fully transparent, immutable and incorruptible.  Everyone who is holding a stake in the BNUGDAO Token can make proposals or vote on proposals regarding  BNUG's future. It is a community driven initiative, carefully designed to empower members with the skill set  required to continuously win in the decentralized future.  As we collectively create more value, that value ﬂows back to the BNUG token, shared by all community  members on our platforms.

BNUG.ﬁnance  Our BNUGLM is a DeFi platform that will enable holders of BNUG and BNB to add liquidity to Pancakeswap and  any other AMM, directly through our liquidity mining protocol BNUGLM, and the LP tokens from Pancakeswap for  providing liquidity will be held in our BNUGLM protocol.  Users who provide BNUG/BNB liquidity on Pancakeswap through our liquidity mining protocol (BNUGLM) will  earn trading rewards from Pancakeswap as liquidity providers, they will also earn 1 BNUGDAO per block of the  total BNUG liquidity they provided.  This is practically how the governance token is mined.  Users can decide to trade BNUGDAO on a centralized or decentralized exchange where we will list it, or they can  choose to hold it for voting rights in the DAO.  The liquidity mining protocol BNUGLM will be the sole admin of the governance token BNUGDAO, hence making it  the only entity able to mint BNUGDAO.  BNUG Stake  BNUG Token holders can stake there BNUG Token and the staking contract will automatically reward them with  more BNUG Token based on the chosen stake period APY.  BNUGDAO NFT Mart  Users holding BNUG Token can easily create and sell their own unique NFTs on our user-friendly NFT creation  platform and sell it on the marketplace or any other marketplace, like opensea etc.  Now everyone can tap into the amazing world of NFTs, not just to proﬁt, but to create inter-generational wealth!  The NFT Mart will also strengthen our \"Blockchain Developer 1000\" initiative since quality blockchain developer  tutorials can be created by developers and minted as NFTs, which in turn can be sold at the BNUG NFTMart.                                                                                     72","Also, our newly launched Blockchain Industry focused news magazine \"Nigeria Blockchain Report\" will be  available for subscription via the BNUG Token.  BNUGDAO LaunchPad  BNUGDAO Token holders can vote for community projects of their choice, qualiﬁed for early stage funding by the  community.  Simply put, the BNUG Token will give you wings to ﬂy if your project is geared towards solving any of the many  Africa developmental problems!  BNUGDAO Studios  Content creators playground.

BNUGDAO Charity  We will support initiative and charity efforts worldwide with an allocated portion of BNUG Token. The world is  much better with friends. The community will from time to time vote on the qualifying course to commit  community funds.  BNUGDAO Ecosystem Development Funds  The African blockchain and crypto ecosystem is one of the largest and fastest-growing in the world today.  Cryptocurrency kick-started the initial digital revolution, and has continued to grow and put thousands of  people on the path towards ﬁnancial freedom.  BNUGDAO Ecosystem Development funds will support industry initiatives, legislative and policy lobbying,  businesses and founders looking to enter the market, with the needed funding to meet their goals.  We will seek to establish innovation hubs across multiple cities in Africa where young entrepreneurs will be  challenged to start utilizing this technology to rebuild Africa's broken systems with open, transparent and  immutable tools of blockchain technology.
